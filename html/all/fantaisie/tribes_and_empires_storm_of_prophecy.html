    tribes and empires : storm of prophecy
</header>
<p>
    The series is set in the fictional world of Novoland and tells the story of loyalty, friendship, enmity and romance between the young descendants during the twilight years of the Duan Dynasty. The Novoland Duan Dynasty/Empire has been in existence for more than 200 years after it was established from a Barbarian invasion. The people adopted the culture of Zhongzhou and despite its outward appearance of power and prosperity, it is showing signs of decay.

    Young prince Muyun Sheng (Huang Xuan), who was born of a beautiful spirit mother, was shunned and disliked since young due to his identity. Having lived in seclusion and loneliness throughout his life, he one day finds out the truth about his mother's death from her previous attendant-in-waiting. Along with the new-found knowledge, he was given a magical pearl which once belonged to his mother. While his brothers fight for the throne, the whimsical half-spirit prince spent his days seeking the mysteries of the gem. To the outside world, he was declared insane and then dead.

    Years later, when the emperor and his brothers died, the abandoned prince was pushed to the throne. Longing for the world of the gem and the woman he saw in it (Janice Man), he escapes the palace by blowing apart the barrier between it and the River Folks. Along with the palace, he left behind chaos and a country under attack on all sides. Leading the attack on land is Shuofeng Heye (Zhou Yiwei), a man who has tamed the wolves and seeks to unify the nomadic tribes and finally give them a home of their own.
